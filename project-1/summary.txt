### Data Cleaning Procedures:

1. Upload the dataset.
2. Check the information of the data to verify that feature data types match their values.
3. Remove duplicate records.
4. Handle missing values.
5. Describe the data and check the range of features. If any values are out of range or unrealistic, remove them from the dataset (for example, age greater than 100).
6. Validate that employment experience is not greater than the person's age. If it is, the data is invalid and should be removed.
7. Remove feature values that are less than zero, as they are not meaningful.
